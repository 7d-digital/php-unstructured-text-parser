Unstructured Text Parser [PHP]
===========================================

This is a PHP Class to help extract text out of text documents that are not structured in a processing friendly manner.

Example:
* Web Pages
* Web Forms Generated Emails
* Documents



Note: This class has been tested on 60+ email templates successfully. The only concern is that when too many templates are added it slows the process in a noticeable manner
